  <h2>About HPC</h2>
  <p>High Performance Computing (HPC) provides compute, memory, and storage resources to run large-scale computations. Typical use cases include simulations, molecular dynamics, machine learning, and batch processing.</p>
  <h3>When to use HPC</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Workloads require much more memory than your desktop.</li>
    <li>You need to run the same program many times or run large parallel jobs.</li>
    <li>Your program can take advantage of GPUs or multiple cores.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Who should use it</h3>
  <p>Researchers and students whose workloads cannot be executed efficiently on a local machine.</p>
